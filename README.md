## Introduction

The purpose of this experiment is to evaluate the accuracy and ease of tracking using various VR headsets over different area sizes, gradually increasing from 100m² to 1000m². This will help in understanding the capabilities and limitations of different devices for large-scale XR applications.

## Who Joins
- Cederik from Executxr

## Requirements

### Hardware

1. VR headsets (e.g., HTC Focus 3, Oculus Quest 3)
2. Wi-Fi 6 router for stable wireless communication
3. Measuring tape or laser distance measurer
4. Markers or cones to delineate the experiment areas
5. Laptop or PC with necessary VR software
6. Power banks (if necessary, for extended sessions)

### Software

1. Appropriate VR software for each headset (e.g., HTC Vive Business Streaming, Oculus software)
2. Data logging software (compatible with selected VR headsets)
3. Spreadsheet software (e.g., Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets) for data analysis
4. Environment mapping software (optional)

## Setup

1. **Define the Experiment Areas**
   - Measure and mark out areas of 100m², 200m², 400m², 600m², 800m², and 1000m² using markers or cones. Ensure each area is free from obstacles that could interfere with tracking.

2. **Set Up the VR Headsets**
   - Fully charge the headsets.
   - Ensure the headsets have the latest firmware updates installed.
   - Connect the headsets to the Wi-Fi 6 network.

3. **Configure the Tracking Environment**
   - Launch the appropriate VR software on the laptop/PC for each headset.
   - Pair the VR headsets with the software.
   - Calibrate the headsets as per the manufacturer's instructions to ensure optimal tracking performance.

4. **Data Logging Setup**
   - Install and configure the data logging software on the VR headsets.
   - Set up the logging parameters to capture positional and rotational data at regular intervals.

## Experiment Procedure

1. **Initial Calibration**
   - Perform a full calibration of the headsets in each designated area.
   - Ensure the headsets can track the entire area without significant drift or loss of tracking.

2. **Tracking Test for Each Zone**
   - Have participants walk, run, and perform various movements within each area size while wearing the headsets.
   - Record the movements using the data logging software.
   - Repeat the test at different times of the day to account for environmental variables such as lighting changes.

3. **Environmental Mapping (Optional)**
   - Use environment mapping software to create a digital map of each test area.
   - Compare the real-world movements with the virtual environment to identify any discrepancies.

## Data Collection

1. **Positional and Rotational Data**
   - Collect data on the position and orientation of the headsets throughout the experiment.
   - Ensure data is recorded at consistent intervals for accuracy.

2. **Environmental Data**
   - Note any environmental conditions that could affect tracking (e.g., lighting, obstacles).

## Data Analysis

1. **Data Cleaning**
   - Remove any outliers or erroneous data points.
   - Ensure data consistency across all recorded sessions.

2. **Accuracy Assessment**
   - Compare the logged positional data with the actual movements performed by the participants.
   - Calculate the average error in tracking and identify any patterns of drift or loss of tracking for each area size.

3. **Performance Evaluation**
   - Assess the ease of setup and calibration.
   - Evaluate the stability and reliability of tracking over the different area sizes for each device.

## Troubleshooting

1. **Tracking Issues**
   - Re-calibrate the headsets if tracking is inconsistent.
   - Ensure there are no reflective surfaces or obstacles interfering with tracking.

2. **Software Problems**
   - Restart the VR software and reconnect the headsets.
   - Check for software updates and patches.

## Conclusion

Summarize the findings of the experiment, highlighting the strengths and limitations of each VR headset for different area sizes. Provide recommendations for future experiments and potential improvements in the tracking setup.
